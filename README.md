# 🎄 Advent Of Code 2023: A Coding Journey

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.
The solutions are crafted in JavaScript.

## 🎅 The Challenges

Each day's challenge resides in its own cozy folder, aptly named `day<day>`. Within, you'll find the input for the riddle of the day (`input.txt`) and the solution for both puzzles (`day<day>_1` & `day<day>_2`).

## 🚀 Ready, Set, Code!

To embark on this journey, you'll need:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

## 🏃 Let's Go!

To execute the solution of a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
# Python
node ./day<day>/day<day>_<1|2>.js
```

```bash
# Go
go run day-<day>/go/main.go
```

```bash
# Rust
cargo run --manifest-path day-<day>/rs/Cargo.toml
```
